# Design discussion

## Confirmed decisions

- Repository name: blockchain-integration-service (user decision, 2026-09-03).
- Source baseline: documentation/BGS_PROJECT_BRIEF.md, imported from the supplied Google Doc.
- Use OpenSpec and settle naming, folder structure, and integration contracts before implementation.
- Preserve the brief's separate game repository and frontend/core/Arkade responsibilities.
- Track planning files under `.openspec/`, with an ignored local `openspec` compatibility link for the stock CLI.
- Grill Me is optional and user-invoked before or after proposal creation. It is not a schema prerequisite; retain `spec-driven`.

## Questions for iteration

1. Retain Blockchain Gaming Services / BGS as product and API names, or align with Blockchain Integration Service?
2. One distributed library with internal layers or multiple packages? Initial recommendation: one package with explicit internal boundaries.
3. Where should source, harness, tests, and docs live? Decide after package boundaries.
4. Who mounts the React overlay and owns its container, styling, focus, resizing, and disposal?
5. Define initialization, availability, account lifecycle, request methods, events, and subscription cleanup.
6. When is connected mode fixed for a run? What happens after logout or account change?
7. How do operation/run IDs prevent duplicate charges and stale success events reviving the wrong checkpoint?
8. Who receives continue payments, creates payment requests without a custom server, and verifies completion?
9. Who issues achievements, funds issuance, defines asset identity, and handles duplicate claims and wallet restoration?
10. Verify current official Arkade Signet wallet, payment, asset, and recovery capabilities before implementation.

These questions and recommendations are not approved design decisions. The next outcome is a reviewed OpenSpec proposal, design, requirements, and tasks.
